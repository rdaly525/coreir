Lenny TODO

Add Following functions to C interface and Python interface
ModuleDef.getInstances() // Note I have changed this to a map of instname ->Instance
ModuleDef.getConnections() //Get all the Wireable* Wireable* pairs 
Wireable.getConnectedWireables() //Get all the Wireables, which this Wireable is connected to (only 1 if no fanout)
//The above two functions I am open to renaming to be less confusing
Wireable.sel(string s) //

Maybe other python convenience functions for traversing the graph. We need to make sure that Caleb can use these functions.

We need to figure out how to do errors in python
Right now I store all errors in the context.
I can check if I have an error with c.hasError(), and print with c.printErrors()
Not sure of the best way to nicely die if there are errors. We should talk about this


Dependent on Ross finishing MetaData
  I want to have file names and line numbers for the C/Python API. This might be a tad annoying to add them back to all the C function calls, but I think there is a way in python to dynamically get this info

//////////////////////////////
Ross TODO

Finish Json Reader and Writer
Create a test that actually writes out a file, and reads it back in.

Metadata
Add metadata basically to everywhere

Change name of ArgKinds -> GenParameters

Get Verilog codegen working again

Think about renaming TypeGen and TypeGenInst to NamedType
Have Type associated with TypeGenInst which is like a cache

When instantiating generators, if the typegen function exists, run it
and cache the type in the typegenInst. Does this mean I need a 'strip' function?

When Generating Modules, prepend lib name in front of module name
Make sure you cannot create two namespaces of the same name
Make sure you cannot create two Instantiables of the same name

Config
  Add config GenParameters to Instantiables
  Add config GenArgs to Instances

change makefile to work with Clang

Add stream operator to Error so I can do
  Error e;
  e << "blah" << type << blah

Should check for cases of modules instantiated in its own module. We dont want module "recursion"

Primitives TODO:
-Add generators for constants
-And Multiply
