From github issue:



The problem was that the following APIs invalidate certain iterators
ModuleDef.disconnect(), Wireable.disconnect(), Wireable.disconnectAll() invalidates iterators from Wireable.getConnectedWireables()and ModuleDef.getConnections()

ModuleDef.removeInstance() invalidates iterators from Wireable.getConnectedWireables(), ModuleDef.getConnections(), ModuleDef.getInstances()

This was causing segfaults in the following pattern:

for (auto inst : def.getInstances() ) {
  if (shouldDelete(inst)) {
    def->removeInstance(inst)
  }
}
The fix I have been using is the following:

vector<Instance*> toDelete;
for (auto inst : def.getInstances() ) {
  if (shouldDelete(inst)) {
    toDelete.push_back(inst);
  }
}
for (auto inst : toDelete) {
  def->removeInstance(inst)
}
